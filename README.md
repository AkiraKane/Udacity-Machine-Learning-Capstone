## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>

As a means to attract and retain customers, Starbucks leverages a rewards program that honors regular customers with special offers not available to the standard customer. In order to understand how customers' behavior and how Starbucks choosesto alter its rewards program to better suit specific customers segments, we will analyze
the users and offer data to give more valuable insights.
